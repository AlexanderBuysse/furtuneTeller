# furtuneTeller 2019
My first school assignment where I had to make a fortune teller with javascript.
There where some requirements, the HTML had to be completely valid and semanticly correct.
The Css had the be in relative values (Rem, em procent)
The Javascript needed at least 2 inputs and the result couldn't be completely random.
In this project i used geolocation.
